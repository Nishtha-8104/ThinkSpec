        "\n",
        "**Problem Statement:**\n",
        "NewYork Metro station wants to establish a TicketDistributor machine that issues tickets for passengers\n",
        "travelling in metro rails. Travelers have options of selecting a ticket for a single trip, round trips or for\n",
        "multiple trips. They can also issue a metro pass for regular passengers or a time card for a day, a week or\n",
        "a month according to their requirements. The discounts on tickets will be provided to frequent travelling\n",
        "passengers. The machine is also supposed to read the metro pass and time cards issued by the metro\n",
        "counters or machine. The ticket rates differ based on whether the traveler is a child or an adult. The\n",
        "machine is also required to recognize original as well as fake currency notes. The typical transaction\n",
        "consists of a user using the display interface to select the type and quantity of tickets and then choosing a\n",
        "payment method of either cash, credit/debit card or smartcard. The ticket or tickets are printed and\n",
        "dispensed to the user. Also the messaging facilities after every transaction are required on the registered\n",
        "number. The system can also be operated comfortably by a touch-screen. A large number of heavy\n",
        "components are to be used. We do not want our system to slow down, and also usability of the machine.\n",
        "The TicketDistributor must be able to handle several exceptions, such as aborting the transaction for\n",
        "incomplete transactions, insufficient amount given by the travelers to the machine, money return in case\n",
        "of aborted transaction, change return after successful transaction, showing insufficient balance in the\n",
        "card, updated information printed on the tickets e.g. departure time, date, time, price, valid from, valid\n",
        "till, validity duration, ticket issued from and destination station. In case of exceptions, an error message is\n",
        "to be displayed. We do not want user feedback after every development stage but after every two stages\n",
        "to save time. The machine is required to work in a heavy load environment such that at the morning and\n",
        "evening time in weekdays, and in weekends performance and efficiency would not get affected.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task:**\n",
        "- Identify and categorize **all relevant stakeholders** who will be impacted by or interact with the system.\n",
        "- Differentiate between **primary end users** (direct users) and **secondary stakeholders** (those indirectly affected).\n",

        "**Contextual Information:**\n",
        "- The Ticket Distributor System is designed for metro stations to facilitate ticket purchasing.\n",
        "- It should support cash, card payments, metro passes, and digital transactions.\n",
        "- Metro authorities, passengers, and maintenance teams may have different concerns.\n",
        "- The system should ensure security, fraud prevention, and accessibility features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instructions:**\n",
        "1. **Classify stakeholders** into **primary (direct users)** and **secondary (indirect users)**.\n",
        "2. For each \"end user\" and \"stakeholders\" seperately, describe:\n",
        "   - Their role\n",
        "\n",
        "**Closing:**\n",
