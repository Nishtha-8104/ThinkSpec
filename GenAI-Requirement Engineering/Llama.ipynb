        "multiple trips. They can also issue a metro pass for regular passengers or a time card for a day, a week or\n",
        "a month according to their requirements. The discounts on tickets will be provided to frequent travelling\n",
        "passengers. The machine is also supposed to read the metro pass and time cards issued by the metro\n",
        "counters or machine. The ticket rates differ based on whether the traveler is a child or an adult. The\n",
        "machine is also required to recognize original as well as fake currency notes. The typical transaction consists of a user using the display interface to select the type and quantity of tickets and then choosing a\n",

        "dispensed to the user. Also the messaging facilities after every transaction are required on the registered\n",
        "number. The system can also be operated comfortably by a touch-screen. A large number of heavy\n",
        "components are to be used. We do not want our system to slow down, and also usability of the machine.\n",

        "of aborted transaction, change return after successful transaction, showing insufficient balance in the\n",
